    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <p>
      For the computer science exepedition we have had to do at least 5 projects:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://alexb.io/calculator/">Make a calculator.</a>
          This calculator allows you to use your keyboard to type in number easily
        </li>
        <li><a href="http://csblog.herokuapp.com/">Our own choice: I chose to make a blog using rails.</a>
          I made this so I could further learn how to use the rails framework to create awesome webapps
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://alexb.io/flux-people/">Our own choice: I made a simple flux example website with alt and react.</a>
          I made this so I could further understand how react works and how their data pipeline: flux works
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://smtcs-chat.herokuapp.com/">Our own choice: I made a chat application with react.</a>
          I made this so I could play around with websockets and realtime chat
        </li>
        <li><a href="#/vindinium">Make a vindinium bot: I made one that is better than the teachers bot.</a>
          I was forced to do this project which I am very glad for because this was my favorite project in the computer science course
        </li>
      </ul>
