            <h4>Who Am I?</h4>

            <p>My name is Alex Bierwagen, who is 14 years old and writes code for a living (I recently got a job).</p>
            <p>I am a freshman at Everest Public High School (Part of <a href="http://summitps.org">Summit Public Schools</a>).</p>
            <p>I have never been out of the country in my life (Excluding Canada near the border) but I really hope I can go
              to some other country out of this continent, maybe the U.K.</p>

            <h4>2 Of my favorite things</h4>

            <p>One of my favorite things in life is friendship.</p>
            <p>I say this because of how friends can cheer you up when you have a bad day but always know when to push your buttons.</p>
            <p>My other favorite thing is programming.</p>
            <p>I really love programming mainly because it lets me create anything I want and I can have control over it to the decimal.</p>

            <h4>My Hobby</h4>

            <p>My hobby is programming because it lets me create anything I would like and I can be a god.</p>
            <p>Programming lets me learn myself so I don't have to be teached by others.</p>
