      Vindinium is a program that allows us to run robots that make their own
      decisions with the help of a computer to fight other robots and try to win.
      We had 2 tournaments that consisted of everyone who wanted to play. The
      basis of the game is that there are mines, taverns and other bots. When
      you run into a mine it claims it for you and deals some damage to you and
      it generates some gold every turn for you. If you want to regain your
      health you should walk into a tavern which uses 2 gold to regain 50 of
      your health.

      My vindinium bot uses this awesome technology called a behavior tree which
      uses test cases to determine what state it currently is in.
      Here is a link to a match that I won <a href="http://52.8.116.125:9000/oah4rk56">link</a>
      Here is an image of the tree that determines what my bot should do:
