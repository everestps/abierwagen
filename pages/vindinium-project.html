      My vindinium bot uses this awesome technology called a behavior tree which
      uses test cases to determine what state it currently is in.
      Here is a link to a match that I won <a href="http://52.8.116.125:9000/oah4rk56">link</a>
      Here is an image of the tree that determines what my bot should do:
